# Front-end Websitte shenanigans
These are random front-end website tests that I'll be storing. Will probably be cool or weird website animations, Javascript stuff, and more.
I intend to keep the code as vanilla as possible. Maybe Bootstrap here and there (if needed/urgently desired)

Tools I'll be using:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- optional: Bootstrap (for responsiveness, and mobile-first design)
- SVG (scene description language. Can create scalable vector images)

### Websites:
- Senbonzakura Kageyosh ( The name of Byakuya Kuchiki's bankai or final release from the anime, Bleach.
